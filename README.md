# Jour et Nuit VS code theme

Starts as a light theme for outdoor environments where I write code during the day. It switches to a dark theme with [DarkModeBuddy](https://github.com/insidegui/DarkModeBuddy) once the light level fall off.

Yes, designed by a [graphic designer](https://anatolyivanov.com/design/) â€”Â me. And a crazy-precise minimal Swiss at that. ðŸ¤ª
